Pyspotify Utils

This repository attempts to make it as simple as possible to integrate pyspotify.

It's currently as simple as 
>>> Spotify().play_album("Stadium Arcadium")

Initialization:

Sadly, that simplicity comes after some initialization steps. I'm looking into making these disappear.

You need to put your own Spotify credentials into credentials.py. They need to be credentials for a Spotify Premium account. 

You also need a spotify_appkey.key in the root directory. You can get this following the tutorial at http://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/quickstart/#application-keys.


Dependencies:

libspotify
pyspotify

Information on installing dependencies at http://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/.


TODO (As in, questions for you and my future self):

The way I handle credentials makes me cringe. Is there a good way to do this?

I currently have the spotify session configured to use a PortAudio sink. Is that better than an ALSA sink? Are there other types I should look into?

How does searching work with playlists? More specifically, can I easily distinguish between owned playlists and other playlists? What about playlists with the same name?
