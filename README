Pyspotify Utils

This repository attempts to make it as simple as possible to integrate pyspotify.

It's currently as simple as 
>>> Spotify().play_album("Stadium Arcadium")

Initialization:

Sadly, that simplicity comes after some initialization steps. I'm looking into making these disappear.

You need to put your own Spotify credentials into credentials.py. They need to be credentials for a Spotify Premium account. 

You also need a spotify_appkey.key in the root directory. You can get this following the tutorial at http://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/quickstart/#application-keys.


Dependencies:

libspotify
pyspotify
